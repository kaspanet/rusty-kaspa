# Rusty Kaspa Core Wallet

## Prerequisites

Latest versions of tools:
* rust 1.70.0+
* wasm-pack 0.12.1+ https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/
* basic-http-server `cargo install basic-http-server`
(alternatively you can use your favorite flavor of http server, just make sure to match the ports in this example)

Both WASM and Native applications are built from the same Rust codebase, so they are identical in their functionality.

## Starting WASM wallet
```
cd wasm
./build-web
cd web
basic-http-server
```
Access the web interface at http://localhost:4000 (`4000` is the default basic-http-server port)

## Starting Native Wallet

```
cd native
cargo run
```
Type `help` for additional help or `exit` to quit the application.

## Basic Operations

(this section will be updated later, it is intended for development)

After starting the wallet shell (native of WASM) and starting a local rusty-kaspa Kaspad node (with `--testnet` and `--utxoindex`), you should perform the following actions:
```
network testnet
server localhost
connect
create
```

- `network` configures the network type (testnet or mainnet), this also helps the system determine default RPC ports
- `server` configures the server address for wRPC Borsh connection
- `connect [<address>]` connects to the given server (`network` and `server` are used to determine the desirable connection endpoint if the address is not specified)
- `create` without arguments (on a new installation) will create a local wallet

At the end, you will get a mnemonic;  preserve that in case you need to reset the wallet storage at a later date.

If receiving a lot of transactions, you can use `mute` and `track <type>` commands to mute and toggle specific types of notifications.

Please use `help` to get a complete list of commands.

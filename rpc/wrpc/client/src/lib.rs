//! # wRPC Client for Rusty Kaspa p2p Node
//!
//! This crate provides a WebSocket RPC client for Rusty Kaspa p2p node. It is based on the
//! [wRPC](https://docs.rs/workflow-rpc) crate that offers WebSocket RPC implementation
//! for Rust based on Borsh and Serde JSON serialization. wRPC is a lightweight RPC framework
//! meant to function as an IPC (Inter-Process Communication) mechanism for Rust applications.
//!
//! Rust examples on using wRPC client can be found in the
//! [examples](https://github.com/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa/tree/master/rpc/wrpc/examples) folder.
//!
//! WASM bindings for wRPC client can be found in the [`kaspa-wrpc-wasm`](https://docs.rs/kaspa-wrpc-wasm) crate.
//!
//! The main struct managing Kaspa RPC client connections is the [`KaspaRpcClient`].
//!
//! ## TLS crypto provider (native)
//!
//! On native targets the client opens secure (`wss://`) connections and, when a
//! [`Resolver`] is used, fetches the public node list over HTTPS — both go
//! through [`rustls`](https://docs.rs/rustls), which (since 0.23) requires a
//! process-level crypto provider to be installed.
//!
//! For zero-config use, this crate installs the pure-Rust `ring` provider
//! automatically the first time a [`KaspaRpcClient`] or [`Resolver`] is
//! constructed (see [`ensure_crypto_provider`]). The install is idempotent and a
//! no-op if a provider has already been installed, so to use a different
//! provider (e.g. `aws-lc-rs`) install it yourself *before* constructing a
//! client:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! rustls::crypto::aws_lc_rs::default_provider().install_default().unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! On `wasm32` the host environment handles TLS, so no provider is required.
//!

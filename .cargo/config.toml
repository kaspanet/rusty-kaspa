# Cargo configuration for musl builds
# This configures linker flags to handle mimalloc conflicts with libstdc++
# Since kaspa-alloc uses mimalloc with 'override' feature (which conflicts with
# libstdc++'s operator new/delete in musl static builds), we use linker flags
# to allow multiple definitions, letting the first one win.

# Kaspa Smart Contracts Technical Design Document

## Executive Summary

This document proposes a phased approach to implementing smart contract functionality in Kaspa, leveraging the existing transaction script system and UTXO architecture. The design extends the current `txscript` engine with new opcodes for contract operations while maintaining Kaspa's performance characteristics and security model.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure
- **Transaction Script Engine**: Sophisticated opcode system with macro-based extensibility
- **WASM Bindings**: Existing infrastructure for wallet/RPC interactions
- **Virtual Processor**: Transaction validation pipeline in consensus layer
- **UTXO Storage**: Efficient key-value storage with caching and batching
- **Hardfork Mechanism**: Proven activation system (Crescendo/KIP-10)

### Key Findings
1. The `crypto/txscript` module provides an extensible foundation for smart contracts
2. UTXO storage architecture can support contract state with minimal modifications
3. Virtual processor has clear integration points for contract validation
4. WASM infrastructure exists but needs extension for contract execution
5. Hardfork activation pattern is well-established for new features

## Proposed Architecture

### Phase 1: Basic Contract Operations
Extend the transaction script system with fundamental smart contract opcodes:

#### New Opcodes
- `OP_CONTRACT_DEPLOY` (0xc0): Deploy a new smart contract
- `OP_CONTRACT_CALL` (0xc1): Execute contract function
- `OP_CONTRACT_STATE_GET` (0xc2): Read contract state
- `OP_CONTRACT_STATE_SET` (0xc3): Write contract state
- `OP_CONTRACT_BALANCE` (0xc4): Get contract balance
- `OP_CONTRACT_TRANSFER` (0xc5): Transfer funds from contract

#### Contract Storage Model
Contracts are stored as special UTXO entries with:
- **Contract Code**: WASM bytecode embedded in UTXO
- **Contract State**: Key-value pairs stored in dedicated storage
- **Contract Balance**: Native KAS balance held by contract

### Phase 2: WASM Execution Environment
Create a sandboxed WASM runtime for contract execution:

#### Runtime Features
- Memory isolation and gas metering
- Host function bindings for blockchain operations
- Deterministic execution guarantees
- Cross-language compilation support (Rust, AssemblyScript, etc.)

#### Gas Model
- Computational complexity-based metering
- Storage operation costs
- Network resource usage limits
- Fee structure aligned with transaction costs

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Contract-to-contract calls
- Event emission and indexing
- Upgradeable contract patterns
- Multi-signature contract wallets

## Implementation Details

### Contract UTXO Structure
```rust
pub struct ContractUtxo {
    pub code_hash: Hash,           // Hash of contract bytecode
    pub state_root: Hash,          // Merkle root of contract state
    pub balance: u64,              // Contract's KAS balance
    pub nonce: u64,                // Prevents replay attacks
}
```

### State Storage
Contract state is stored separately from UTXO set:
- Key-value store with contract address prefix
- Merkle tree structure for state verification
- Efficient diff tracking for consensus validation

### Transaction Validation Integration
Contract validation occurs during UTXO context validation:
1. Parse contract opcodes from transaction scripts
2. Execute contract code in sandboxed WASM runtime
3. Validate state changes and balance transfers
4. Update contract storage and UTXO set

### Hardfork Activation
Follow Crescendo pattern with new KIP:
- **KIP-15**: Smart Contract Activation
- Activation at specific DAA score
- Backward compatibility for non-contract transactions
- Gradual rollout with testnet validation

## Security Considerations

### Consensus Safety
- Deterministic WASM execution
- Gas limits prevent infinite loops
- State validation in consensus pipeline
- Replay attack prevention

### Economic Security
- Fee structure prevents spam
- Storage costs for state usage
- Contract deployment costs
- Balance verification

### Runtime Security
- Memory isolation between contracts
- Host function access controls
- Stack overflow protection
- Integer overflow checks

## Performance Impact

### Consensus Overhead
- Contract validation adds ~10-20% to transaction processing
- WASM execution optimized for blockchain use
- Parallel validation where possible
- Caching of compiled contract code

### Storage Requirements
- Contract code stored once per deployment
- State storage grows with usage
- Efficient pruning strategies
- Compression for large contracts

### Network Impact
- Larger transaction sizes for contract operations
- Additional RPC endpoints for contract interaction
- Event indexing for dApp development

## Conclusion

This design provides a practical path to smart contract implementation in Kaspa while preserving the network's core strengths. The phased approach allows for iterative development and community feedback, ensuring a robust and secure smart contract platform.

The proposed architecture leverages existing infrastructure, minimizes consensus changes, and maintains Kaspa's performance characteristics. With proper implementation and testing, smart contracts can significantly expand Kaspa's utility while maintaining its position as a high-performance cryptocurrency.

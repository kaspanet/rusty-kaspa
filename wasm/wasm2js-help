                                                behavior deterministically (the
                                                default is to not care about 
                                                what would trap in wasm, like a
                                                load out of bounds or integer 
                                                divide by zero; with this flag,
                                                we try to be deterministic at 
                                                least in what happens, which 
                                                might or might not be to trap 
                                                like wasm, but at least should 
                                                not vary)

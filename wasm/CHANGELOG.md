### Release 2024-04-27
 - IAccountsCreateRequest interface simplified by flattering it and now it is union for future expansion for multisig etc.
 - IWalletEvent interface updated for Events with TransactionRecord
 - WIP: wallet api example under wallet/wallet.js
 - Bug fixes: wallet.ensure_default_account, ECDSA address creation methods

### Release 2024-04-17

- Rename RPC "open" and "close" events to "connect" and "disconnect", TypeScript `RpcEventType.Open` and `RpcEventType.Close` enums to `RpcEventType.Connect` and `RpcEventType.Disconnect` (the renaming is done to prevent confusion in other layers of the WASM SDK where "open" and "close" event names represent the Wallet open state).
- `RpcClient.open` boolean state getter renamed to `RpcClient.connected`
- Fix examples missed during `publicKey()->toPublicKey()` rename.

### Release 2024-04-17

- Transaction::addresses() returns a list of unique addresses used by transaction inputs
- PendingTransaction::addresses change from getter to a function
- Address::validate(string) static helper to test address validity

### Release 2024-04-14

- Merge with Rusty Kaspa master (0.13.6)

### Release 2024-04-13

- Change `signTransaction()` to accept `Transaction` instead of `SignableTransaction`
- Remove `SignableTransaction` from the SDK (as `Transaction` now provides all signing functionality)
- Fix a bug in `TransactionRecord` that was returning incorrect getter for `record.data`
- Added `Transaction::addresses()` that returns address list for all UTXOs associated with transaction inputs.
- Fix declarations of events (RpcClient,UtxoProcessor) that do not carry any event data (event data is now declared as `undefined`)

### Release 2024-03-31

- Rename `kaspa-beacon` app to `kaspa-resolver`
- Change RpcClient, UtxoProcessor and Wallet event handlers in typescript to receive typed event data
- UtxoProcessor and Wallet event handlers now deliver TransactionRecord events (Discovery, Pending, etc.)
as Rust or WASM objects, allowing user to call `hasAddress(<address>)` on the received `event.data.record` object.

### Release 2024-03-19

- Fix type checks when passing arrays to transaction `Generator` entries.

### Release 2024-03-14

- Introduce IWASM32BindingsConfig for configuration of class naming when using WASM32 bindings.
- Introduce serializeToJSON for `PendingTransaction` class (deserializable with `Transaction` class).
- Introduce serializeToJSON and deserializeFromJSON methods for `Transaction` class.

### Release 2024-03-11

- Fix `requestAnimationFrame` use in chrome extension environment.
- Add rejection in `Generator` when `priorityFee` is `undefined` while outputs are present.
- Introduce `CryptoBox` class for encryption/decryption of data using public/private keys.
- sha256x and other hash functions now have two variants sha256FromBinary and sha256FromText
- Changed `XPub.publicKey()` to `XPub.toPublicKey()`
- Most functions returning key strings now return `PrivateKey` or `PublicKey`; this allows function chaining `xpub.deriveChild(0).toPublicKey().toAddress(networkId).toString()`
- `PrivateKey` now has `toPublicKey()`, `toAddress()`, `toAddressECDSA()` methods
- Introduce `XOnlyPublicKey` which can be obtained from `PublicKey`: `xpub.toXOnlyPublicKey()` and `xpub.toXOnlyPublicKey().toAddress(networkId)`. 

### Release 2024-02-26

- Add `UtxoProcessor.start()/stop()` methods for explicit start/stop of the `UtxoProcessor` event processing.
- Remove `async` markers from UtxoProcessor and UtxoContext constructors.
- Add `UtxoProcessor.setNetworkId()` method to change the network ID for existing `UtxoProcessor` (`UtxoProcessor` must be stopped before changing the network id).
- Add `UtxoProcessor.networkId` property to get the current network ID.
- Add `UtxoContext.matureLength()` and `matureRange(from,to)` for access to mature UTXO entries.


### Release 2024-02-25

#### Event Listener API updates
- Event Listener API has been refactored to mimic DOM standard (similar to `addEventListener` / `removeEventListener` available in the browser, but with additional features)
- replace `RpcClient.notify()` with `RpcClient.addEventListener()` / `RpcClient.removeEventListener()`
- `addEventListener()` calls have been standardized between RPC, UtxoProcessor, Wallet
- You can now register multiple listeners for the same event type and unregister them individually
- A single registration can accept an array of events to listen to e.g. `["open", "close"]`

#### Other updates
- RpcClient events now support `open`, `close` events to signal the RPC connection state
- RPC events now contain `type` and `data` fields (instead of listeners receiving 2 arguments)
- Rename client-side `Beacon` class to `Resolver`
- ITransactionRecord properties now have appropriate interfaces
- ITransactionData serialization fields have changed from (`transaction = {}` to `data = {}`)

### Release 2024-02-19

- Fix large RPC response deserialization errors in NodeJS caused by the default WebSocket frame size limit.
- Fix event processing in UtxoContext
- Renamed `XPrivateKey` to `PrivateKeyGenerator` and `XPublicKey` to `PublicKeyGenerator`
- Simplify conversion between different key types (`XPrv->Keypair`, `XPrv->XPub->Pubkey`, etc)
- Introduced `Beacon` class that provides connectivity to the community-operated public node infrastructure (backed by `kaspa-beacon` load balancer & node status monitor)
- Created TypeScript type definitions across the entire SDK and refactored `RpcClient` class (as well as many other components) to use TypeScript interfaces
- Changed documentation structure to use `typedoc` available as a part of redistributables or online at https://kaspa.aspectron.org/docs/
- Project-wide documentation updates
- Additional self-contained Web Browser examples
- Modified the structure of WASM32 SDK release to include all variants of libraries (both release and dev builds), examples and documentation in a single package.
